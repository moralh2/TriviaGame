Trivia Game HW (JS Assignment 2)

This game was created to learn how to use JS Time Events -- specifically setInterval in this case. 
In the trivia game, the timer determines how long to await for the user to respond; or if the user clicks on an answer, an event stops the timer. The timer object was also used to display certain messages for a set number of seconds.

The theme chosen for the game was Futurama, a show I used to watch a lot way back when. The game runs through 10 questions; upon the timer expiring or the user submitting an answer, the correct answer and it's matching gif are displayed, followed by another message and gif depending on whether the user answered correctly or not, or not at all. Once all questions are answered, the game over screen shows the score, and the option to restart.
